D2Smells2 is a Diablo 2 packet sniffer based off of D2Smells by Eric Thibeault Jolin (2007).  The original plans were to continue development on D2Smells based on publicly available source (http://bhfiles.com/files/Diablo%20II/1.12a/D2Smells_Source.rar).  Because this is a self educating project, I find plenty of merit in reinventing the wheel.  Feel free to watch, branch, or join in.
